## Description

Trust Mint is a decentralized system for secure and transparent file storage using NFTs. It leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to encrypt and decrypt files, ensuring authorized access. Trust Mint utilizes IPFS for decentralized storage, enhancing security and availability. The contract deployed in Motoko handles NFT minting and management, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of digital assets. Built on the Internet Computer platform, Trust Mint benefits from the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for decentralized and secure computation. With a user-friendly interface powered by React JS and Plug Wallet-based authentication, Trust Mint enables effortless file management, empowering users with control over their data in a decentralized manner.

- **ICP (Internet Computer Protocol):** Trust Mint is deployed on the Internet Computer platform, which utilizes the ICP protocol. ICP enables decentralized and secure computation, providing a reliable and scalable infrastructure for running Trust Mint.

- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Trust Mint leverages IPFS for decentralized storage of files. IPFS allows files to be stored and retrieved in a distributed manner, reducing reliance on centralized servers and enhancing redundancy and availability.

- **React JS:** The project utilizes React JS to build the user interface. React JS is a popular JavaScript library that enables the creation of dynamic and interactive components, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Vite:** Trust Mint employs Vite as a build tool. Vite offers fast and efficient development server capabilities and optimized build processes, resulting in improved productivity and performance.

- **Tailwind CSS:** The project uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS allows for the rapid creation of responsive and modern designs by providing a comprehensive set of utility classes that can be easily customized.

## Results

Trust Mint revolutionizes the way files are stored securely and transparently. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, NFTs, and IPFS, Trust Mint achieves the following results:

- **Enhanced Security:** Files are encrypted and decrypted using NFTs, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify the files. The decentralized nature of IPFS adds an extra layer of security, reducing the risk of single points of failure.

- **Data Ownership:** With Trust Mint, users have full control and ownership over their files. By leveraging blockchain technology, Trust Mint removes the need for intermediaries, enabling direct and secure file storage and retrieval.

- **Decentralized File Storage:** Trust Mint utilizes IPFS for decentralized storage, offering improved redundancy and availability. This distributed approach ensures that files remain accessible even if individual nodes go offline.

- **Transparent and Auditable:** Trust Mint's blockchain-based system allows for transparent and auditable file history. Each transaction and modification made to the files is recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable record of changes.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Trust Mint provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface built with React JS. The interface allows users to easily upload, store, and access their files, making the file management experience seamless and enjoyable.

With Trust Mint, users can confidently store their files knowing they are protected, secure, and accessible.
